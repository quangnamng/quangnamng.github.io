Welcome to my site!For my personal and research information, please see About and Research.This site stores some of my notes on the topics that interest me:  Robotics  Physics  PhotographyMy passion for research has been inspired by this quote by Albert Einstein about the Intelligibility of the universe:  “The most incomprehensible thing about the world is that it is comprehensible.”And I strongly agree with Isaac Newton’s view on Intelligent Design:  “The wonderful arrangement and harmony of the cosmos would only originate in the plan of an almighty omniscient being. This is and remains my greatest comprehension.”"

    "content": "Some photos about Singapore’s history, taken at the National Museum of Singapore, in chronological order.Singapura (1299 - 1818)Crown Colony (1819 - 1941)Rickshaw (1880s - 1930s)Rickshaws were in Singapore’s street between 1880s-1930s. Here is a video of Hock Lam Street (now replaced by Funan Centre) during 1920-1929. In 1911, the British colonial government banned double-seater rickshaws on humanitarian grounds. In 1947, all types of hand pulled rickshaws were banned thanks to the development of pedal trishaws in the 1930s.Syonan-To (1942 - 1945)Syonan-To means “Light of the South”. This feels personal.British return (1945 - 1959)In 1959, the British granted Singapore self-government, which marked the first general election of Singapore in the same year. Singapore wanted to be a part of Malaya (Malaysia) in order to ensure its economic survival and also halt the spread of communism. However, this merger survived for only 2 years from 1963 to 1965 due to political disagreements. “Thanks to” this separation, Singapore became independent on 9 August 1965.Singapore (1965 - present)Taken at National Museum of Singapore (30/09/2021)"
