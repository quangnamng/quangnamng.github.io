_Rickshaw (1880s - 1930s)_

Rickshaws were in Singapore's street between 1880s-1930s. 
Here is a [video](https://youtu.be/RdolrWjzyVo) of Hock Lam Street (now replaced 
by Funan Centre) during 1920-1929. 
In 1911, the British colonial government banned double-seater rickshaws on 
humanitarian grounds. 
In 1947, all types of hand pulled rickshaws were banned thanks to the development 
of pedal trishaws in the 1930s.

_British return (1945 - 1959)_

In 1959, the British granted Singapore self-government, which marked the first 
general election of Singapore in the same year. 
Singapore wanted to be a part of Malaya (Malaysia) in order to ensure its 
economic survival and also halt the spread of communism. 
However, this merger survived for only 2 years from 1963 to 1965 due to 
political disagreements. 
"Thanks to" this separation, Singapore became independent on 9 August 1965.
