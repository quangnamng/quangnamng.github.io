Hi, I'm **Nam**. Welcome to my site!

For my personal and research information, please see 
[About](https://quangnamng.github.io/about/) 
and [Research](https://quangnamng.github.io/research/).

This site stores some of my notes on the topics that interest me:
* Robotics
* Physics
* Photography

My passion for research has been inspired by this quote by Albert Einstein 
about the Intelligibility of the universe:
> "The most incomprehensible thing about the world is that it is comprehensible."

And I strongly agree with Isaac Newton's view on Intelligent Design:
> "The wonderful arrangement and harmony of the cosmos would only 
> originate in the plan of an almighty omniscient being. 
> This is and remains my greatest comprehension."
